## What l learned from  these technologies.

The learnig i had was a reinforcement of my skills with my team , using html , css , javascript and Git with GitHub. Using both the responsiveness part and also javascript animation as an interactive part.
We also lerned  the commits that are very important in the professional area how to use git itself
